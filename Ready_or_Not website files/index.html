                        <p>
                            Throughout the team, we have strong leaders and meticulous executors.
                            We also have attentive defender, which is already the quality
                            needed for a potential team. According to the results of the
                            Myers-Briggs test for each person in the team, we are delighted
                            that each of us has a different personality. There are defender,
                            entrepreneur, and consul among us. They are very well organised
                            when they get toghter. They are also willing to lend a helping
                            hand when their teammates are in trouble. This is why they are
                            the one of the best choices to be a co-workers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In fact, our team is not mature enough, that means we need to
                            keep learning, so it is also particularly important to know
                            the learning habits of each team member. We are pleased to find
                            that the learning styles of our team members cover all three
                            learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. We are pleased
                            to see that the learning styles of our team members cover all
                            three learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. Each of
                            us has different ways and methods of acquiring knowledge. When
                            such people form a team, the team can acquire and develop knowledge
                            from different ways and means at the same time. Consequently, this
                            team can develop and mature much faster than others.

                                African, born in Libya, Tripoli. I have gained
                                an interest in cybersecurity and computers in
                                general and decided to take the IT Bachelor
                                course with Rmit University. This is my first
                                year and first semester, so everything is new
                                to me! I love building computers and putting
                                together things and love to find out more about
                                how things work together.

                                My name is Adrian Ghitoaica, I am Romanian,
                                currently undergoing my bachelor’s in
                                construction management (Honours) in second
                                year, I can speak Romanian, and I like outdoor
                                activities like fishing, camping. I am pursuing
                                my first degree and am set to graduate by 2024

                                skillset, hence choosing this course.

                                and I moved to Australia for my higher education.
                                Sri Lanka is a popular tourist destination. I got
                                my secondary education in a very prestigious
                                institution with a history of over 100 years. I
                                wanted to pursue my career in the field of business
                                since my childhood and I chose a college which has
                                an affiliation with an Australian university, I
                                completed my diploma and transferred to RMIT.

                                my childhood. Cricket is my favourite game and I
                                have been playing that sport since primary school.

                                for a couple of years due to covid, once everything was
                                back to normal, I joined RMIT cricket club as the opening

                            Our team members choose Ideal Jobs on different principles.
                            For example, some people want to find a well-paying job and don't
                            care much about the content of the job. Others will choose a job
                            from the field they are interested in. Some of us want to be a
                            data analyzer, some of us want to be a manager, and others want
                            to develop software and have fun with coding. The table on the left shows
                            the differences in our respective Ideal Jobs and the selection criteria.
                            <br /><br />
                            Through our comparisons, we found that each person chose the most
                            appropriate career for their interests and that each person's choice
                            was equally matched to their personality traits. This is very interesting
                            and makes us work better together!

                                    The original problem that this project will aim to terminate,
                                    is the issue of not being able to track our diets accurately
                                    and maintain healthy level of food intake. This software will
                                    aim to benefit humanity from reducing the ecological impact of
                                    mankind on the planet to helping people maintain healthier
                                    lifestyles through this project.

                                    This project consists of a software that is designed to scan
                                    barcodes on items and tell you exactly how much calories,
                                    kilojoules, ingredients and everything else that is in the
                                    food. The software can also keep track of all food that you
                                    have eaten, all food you have bought and all food you have
                                    stored away. Another cool feature of this software is the
                                    recipe lookup, it checks to see what foods are in the inventory
                                    and scores the web for recipes that can be made with what’s
                                    available This software is a sort of food organizing, monitoring
                                    and developing software which helps users watch their calorie intake,
                                    cook healthy meals and know what they are missing in their fridges or
                                    storages.

                                    This project will help millions if not billions of people. Everyone

                                    getting enough nutrients, however not everyone has the time to figure

                                    over your limits or not, making it 10x easier than doing the research
                                    and paying a professional. Furthermore, keeping track of the items,
                                    you buy and what you are missing for your plans helps you organize
                                    and possibly save money on certain food aspects. This software will
                                    be the go-to application to figure out a 5-star meal plan and ingredient
                                    sorter.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The main software will be produced entirely as a program on devices
                                    or an application. Users can download it on their phones, computers,
                                    iPad and even smart Tv’s to a point. Depending on the device some
                                    features may not be available due to capabilities restriction, for
                                    example a tv may be too slow to implement some aspects of the program.
                                    The software will be sold to smart fridge companies or will be working
                                    in partnership with other companies to either integrate this software
                                    or expand on it further to suit our needs. However, selling the entire
                                    program as a whole will not be an option as it will be an exclusive
                                    program which holds up against competitors. If it is sold to other companies,
                                    they can describe to us what features they would like to include and they
                                    if they want to redesign the program that can also be granted as long as
                                    Ready_Or_Not brand is advertised. As this software gains popularity around
                                    the world suggestions will be given and features will be added along the way.

                                    <h4>Main Software</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The software includes a barcode scanner which scans
                                    the item and finds it online with all its product
                                    information. This can be directly taken from the
                                    manufacturer of the product, and it will copy a quick
                                    summary of the information and it will post the link
                                    and the location of the manufacturer.
                                </div>

                                <div class="row border-bottom pb-5 mb-5"
                                    style="padding: 0px 10em; text-align: justify;">
                                    <h4>How the barcode scanning works</h4>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Every product will have a UPC barcode which identifies
                                            what product it is and its details </b>
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The way the software identifies items is through barcoded items.
                                    If you go open your fridge right now you can see almost all your
                                    foods in there have a “UPC” (UNIVERSAL PRODUCT CODE) barcode
                                    printed on the packaging. Matter of fact anything that you buy
                                    from any grocery store, especially Coles, Woolworths etc., use
                                    a UPC barcode to identify their merchandise. This is so business
                                    can keep track of their merchandise and to provide an easier more
                                    faster check out.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The software is also integrated for fridges and or cupboards to
                                    keep track of foods and items stored. The way this will work is,
                                    if the software is integrated for a fridge, it will act as an
                                    interface for the fridge on the fridge smart screen. Users can
                                    bring the product code up to the interface and it will scan it and
                                    scour the internet for its details and information and where it has
                                    come from. From there users can also choose what to do with the
                                    item, either flag it as an ingredient for a food they are cooking
                                    or an item that is going to be stored. The software will list calorie
                                    and ingredient information if it’s going to be cooked or eaten, if it
                                    is going to be stored it will tell the suggested temperature and
                                    location that it will need to be stored at to stay perfect. You can
                                    also go to the storage in the software and add items that you must see
                                    what foods you can make with what you have. This will allow the software
                                    to scour the internet for every possible combination of ingredients to
                                    see what foods you can make.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Items that you add to the software are also stored in a database so
                                    that they are saved for faster load times next time you scan the item.
                                    Items that you use the most will be added to favorites and every month
                                    the software will let you know what foods, ingredients and dishes you
                                    are favorite and are used the most.

                                    <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    If the project is successful, we will see the food, cooking, health industries
                                    change
                                    for technology and software that provides them with the features that this software
                                    has.
                                    Not only will people stop paying specialists and all these other sources of health
                                    monitors, but they will also rely on this software to provide them with their
                                    dietary
                                    needs daily maintaining their healthy lifestyles. This software will dramatically
                                    make
                                    their lives easier. This will change the industry completely. Health practitioners
                                    and
                                    diet specialist will be less in demand. Even gym memberships will be less sought out
                                    after
                                    as this software will cover most weight loss and goals of health enthusiasts.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Some features which may come with the software include a water reminder.
                                    For example, if software is integrated into a smart fridge, it will have
                                    a drink water reminder letting you know when you need to drink water. The way this
                                    will work is store how much mL of water you drink depending on how much you fill
                                    your cup from the fridge.

                                    Another feature is storing item prices. Each item scanned will see how much the
                                    average price for that item is, and the more items you store in the storage of the
                                    software it will add up the estimated cost and how much monthly it would cost you to
                                    maintain your items that you store.

                                    This software can take advantage of the internet of things and become a part of the
                                    households’ devices and combine them into one. It can use smart watches that monitor
                                    health and smart alarm clock to monitor sleep schedules to provide the best possible
                                    food item suggestions to help boost our health. It will be able to use the
                                    environment for a better understanding and management of food items that is scanned.

                                    Shopping lists can be added into this software to ensure users never forget what
                                    they need at the supermarket, you are able to add items and can even directly be
                                    relocated to a Woolworths or a relevant store to order that food directly.

                                    If the software is integrated as a fridge software, it can link to a maps app and
                                    know when you are on the way home, so it will stop freezing certain foods or lets
                                    foods become warmer so when you arrive home, they will be ready to prepare.

                                    <h4>Example of the software</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    You open the software on your phone or a fridge or any other device, you scan the
                                    item: “cooked tomato pasta” the item will be added to the software and record the
                                    current date and time and adds the products expiration date, so we never stale or
                                    spoil the food added.
                                </div>

                                <div class="row border-bottom pb-5 mb-5"

                                    <h4>Software disadvantages/issues/restraints</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    UPC barcodes can be the same for the same brand shampoos. For example, heads and
                                    shoulders could have the same barcode for 2 of their shampoo brands. This is a issue
                                    when it comes to storing items in the fridge it may not recognize the item and will
                                    have trouble giving accurate results. This can be overcome with RFID tagging where
                                    RFID technology is able to give every product a unique identifier representing the
                                    product name and expiration date however, RDID tagging is most common in expensive
                                    clothing and higher value items as it costs about 10 cents a tag while UPC tags cost
                                    around 1 cent to implement, so generally food item manufacturers won’t opt out to
                                    RFID tagging.

                                    To make this software suitable technology is required. A suitable fast CPU with
                                    enough gigahertz to be fast enough. Enough RAM since this is a software developing
                                    project, we are going to need at least ATLEAST 16 gigabytes of RAM. Display is not a
                                    big problem as of developing this project. We would need an SSD for them fast data
                                    retrievals and quick boot ups to get to developing this project faster. GPUs aren’t
                                    of interest as well as we aren’t making application for graphical applications.

                                        This software will be very complex so coding languages such as HTML, JavaScript,
                                        CSS, Python etc. not knowing coding languages will make us struggle to even
                                        start on this project. It’s important to specialize in coding languages in order
                                        to add all the features of this software.

                                        Databases allow us to organize structure and information or in this case, food
                                        items and data on the items, we will need to know how to search for information
                                        to input these lines of information into a table format and organize into a
                                        secure database to use in our software.

                                        This is for storing information into a database while algorithms describe the
                                        process required to complete a task. We will need to know how to pick out data
                                        structures and algorithms to determine which combination can optimize the
                                        programs code.

                                        Every software in the world undergoes a testing process before a company
                                        releases it to users or consumers. Its just knowing how to test the software and
                                        using the correct digital tools to ensure that the software works and fulfills
                                        our design requirements.

                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Debugging is for our code part of the software. This is where we
                                        remove errors in our programs code and address them without problem-solving
                                        skills to determine where the error is occurring. Its important to know
                                        strategies for removing errors and develop an effective process to making sure
                                        the program works effectively.

                                        Operating system knowledge will help us understand how our software will run on
                                        different devices. It will help us conduct testing procedures and change lines
                                        of codes between them to fit the operating system.

                                        a software framework is a application that developers can use to create a
                                        program using information such as lines of codes that you already wrote before
                                        from other developers. Each operating system has a different framework. We will
                                        need to know different types of frameworks so that we have a wide variety of
                                        options to pick out from and develop our software in the best way possible.

                                    With the video games, the industry is large, it's probably the biggest in terms of
                                    revenue and actual profit. It's probably the biggest industry compared to, say, film
                                    and TV and music. Those industries combined still generates less money than video
                                    games. So, it's quite a large industry and it's obviously catering to a big

                                    My work, I think most of the time is spent managing.

                                    There's a lot officer, discussions and negotiations, probably the hardest part of

                                    focusing on work, but you also get wrapped up in it and you get into a trend like
                                    mindset of I'm going to do this over again and then it gets a bit extensive.

                                    The IT industry work that I do, I mean I couldn't really tell you because a lot of
                                    it is like kind of back-end stuff in that project. Video games like these, you know,
                                    it's all back end, technically it's ‘under the hood’. I'm not sure if I could share
                                    anything.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp; In that sense, I can probably give you files of data statistics and
                                    analysis we used in the project.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s 4000 different files and I don't know. I can't really give you the
                                    picture. I think I agree with that, but hopefully that helps you know, hopefully
                                    gives you an idea of this aspect because it is a big aspect of video game, so just
                                    don't have a Direct Line into it.
