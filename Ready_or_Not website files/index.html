                        <p>
                            Throughout the team, we have strong leaders and meticulous executors.
                            We also have attentive defender, which is already the quality
                            needed for a potential team. According to the results of the
                            Myers-Briggs test for each person in the team, we are delighted
                            that each of us has a different personality. There are defender,
                            entrepreneur, and consul among us. They are very well organised
                            when they get toghter. They are also willing to lend a helping
                            hand when their teammates are in trouble. This is why they are
                            the one of the best choices to be a co-workers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In fact, our team is not mature enough, that means we need to
                            keep learning, so it is also particularly important to know
                            the learning habits of each team member. We are pleased to find
                            that the learning styles of our team members cover all three
                            learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. We are pleased
                            to see that the learning styles of our team members cover all
                            three learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. Each of
                            us has different ways and methods of acquiring knowledge. When
                            such people form a team, the team can acquire and develop knowledge
                            from different ways and means at the same time. Consequently, this
                            team can develop and mature much faster than others.

                                African, born in Libya, Tripoli. I have gained
                                an interest in cybersecurity and computers in
                                general and decided to take the IT Bachelor
                                course with Rmit University. This is my first
                                year and first semester, so everything is new
                                to me! I love building computers and putting
                                together things and love to find out more about
                                how things work together.

                                My name is Adrian Ghitoaica, I am Romanian,
                                currently undergoing my bachelor’s in
                                construction management (Honours) in second
                                year, I can speak Romanian, and I like outdoor
                                activities like fishing, camping. I am pursuing
                                my first degree and am set to graduate by 2024

                                skillset, hence choosing this course.

                                and I moved to Australia for my higher education.
                                Sri Lanka is a popular tourist destination. I got
                                my secondary education in a very prestigious
                                institution with a history of over 100 years. I
                                wanted to pursue my career in the field of business
                                since my childhood and I chose a college which has
                                an affiliation with an Australian university, I
                                completed my diploma and transferred to RMIT.

                                my childhood. Cricket is my favourite game and I
                                have been playing that sport since primary school.

                                for a couple of years due to covid, once everything was
                                back to normal, I joined RMIT cricket club as the opening

                            Our team members choose Ideal Jobs on different principles.
                            For example, some people want to find a well-paying job and don't
                            care much about the content of the job. Others will choose a job
                            from the field they are interested in. Some of us want to be a
                            data analyzer, some of us want to be a manager, and others want
                            to develop software and have fun with coding. The table on the left shows
                            the differences in our respective Ideal Jobs and the selection criteria.
                            <br /><br />
                            Through our comparisons, we found that each person chose the most
                            appropriate career for their interests and that each person's choice
                            was equally matched to their personality traits. This is very interesting
                            and makes us work better together!

                                    The original problem that this project will aim to terminate,
                                    is the issue of not being able to track our diets accurately
                                    and maintain healthy level of food intake. This software will
                                    aim to benefit humanity from reducing the ecological impact of
                                    mankind on the planet to helping people maintain healthier
                                    lifestyles through this project.

                                    This project consists of a software that is designed to scan
                                    barcodes on items and tell you exactly how much calories,
                                    kilojoules, ingredients and everything else that is in the
                                    food. The software can also keep track of all food that you
                                    have eaten, all food you have bought and all food you have
                                    stored away. Another cool feature of this software is the
                                    recipe lookup, it checks to see what foods are in the inventory
                                    and scores the web for recipes that can be made with what’s
                                    available This software is a sort of food organizing, monitoring
                                    and developing software which helps users watch their calorie intake,
                                    cook healthy meals and know what they are missing in their fridges or
                                    storages.

                                    This project will help millions if not billions of people. Everyone

                                    getting enough nutrients, however not everyone has the time to figure

                                    over your limits or not, making it 10x easier than doing the research
                                    and paying a professional. Furthermore, keeping track of the items,
                                    you buy and what you are missing for your plans helps you organize
                                    and possibly save money on certain food aspects. This software will
                                    be the go-to application to figure out a 5-star meal plan and ingredient
                                    sorter.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The main software will be produced entirely as a program on devices
                                    or an application. Users can download it on their phones, computers,
                                    iPad and even smart Tv’s to a point. Depending on the device some
                                    features may not be available due to capabilities restriction, for
                                    example a tv may be too slow to implement some aspects of the program.
                                    The software will be sold to smart fridge companies or will be working
                                    in partnership with other companies to either integrate this software
                                    or expand on it further to suit our needs. However, selling the entire
                                    program as a whole will not be an option as it will be an exclusive
                                    program which holds up against competitors. If it is sold to other companies,
                                    they can describe to us what features they would like to include and they
                                    if they want to redesign the program that can also be granted as long as
                                    Ready_Or_Not brand is advertised. As this software gains popularity around
                                    the world suggestions will be given and features will be added along the way.

                                    <h4>Main Software</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The software includes a barcode scanner which scans
                                    the item and finds it online with all its product
                                    information. This can be directly taken from the
                                    manufacturer of the product, and it will copy a quick
                                    summary of the information and it will post the link
                                    and the location of the manufacturer.
                                </div>

                                <div class="row border-bottom pb-5 mb-5"
                                    style="padding: 0px 10em; text-align: justify;">
                                    <h4>How the barcode scanning works</h4>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Every product will have a UPC barcode which identifies
                                            what product it is and its details </b>
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The way the software identifies items is through barcoded items.
                                    If you go open your fridge right now you can see almost all your
                                    foods in there have a “UPC” (UNIVERSAL PRODUCT CODE) barcode
                                    printed on the packaging. Matter of fact anything that you buy
                                    from any grocery store, especially Coles, Woolworths etc., use
                                    a UPC barcode to identify their merchandise. This is so business
                                    can keep track of their merchandise and to provide an easier more
                                    faster check out.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The software is also integrated for fridges and or cupboards to
                                    keep track of foods and items stored. The way this will work is,
                                    if the software is integrated for a fridge, it will act as an
                                    interface for the fridge on the fridge smart screen. Users can
                                    bring the product code up to the interface and it will scan it and
                                    scour the internet for its details and information and where it has
                                    come from. From there users can also choose what to do with the
                                    item, either flag it as an ingredient for a food they are cooking
                                    or an item that is going to be stored. The software will list calorie
                                    and ingredient information if it’s going to be cooked or eaten, if it
                                    is going to be stored it will tell the suggested temperature and
                                    location that it will need to be stored at to stay perfect. You can
                                    also go to the storage in the software and add items that you must see
                                    what foods you can make with what you have. This will allow the software
                                    to scour the internet for every possible combination of ingredients to
                                    see what foods you can make.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Items that you add to the software are also stored in a database so
                                    that they are saved for faster load times next time you scan the item.
                                    Items that you use the most will be added to favorites and every month
                                    the software will let you know what foods, ingredients and dishes you
                                    are favorite and are used the most.

                                    <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    If the project is successful, we will see the food, cooking, health industries
                                    change
                                    for technology and software that provides them with the features that this software
                                    has.
                                    Not only will people stop paying specialists and all these other sources of health
                                    monitors, but they will also rely on this software to provide them with their
                                    dietary
                                    needs daily maintaining their healthy lifestyles. This software will dramatically
                                    make
                                    their lives easier. This will change the industry completely. Health practitioners
                                    and
                                    diet specialist will be less in demand. Even gym memberships will be less sought out
                                    after
                                    as this software will cover most weight loss and goals of health enthusiasts.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Some features which may come with the software include a water reminder.
                                    For example, if software is integrated into a smart fridge, it will have
                                    a drink water reminder letting you know when you need to drink water. The way this
                                    will work is store how much mL of water you drink depending on how much you fill
                                    your cup from the fridge.

                                    Another feature is storing item prices. Each item scanned will see how much the
                                    average price for that item is, and the more items you store in the storage of the
                                    software it will add up the estimated cost and how much monthly it would cost you to
                                    maintain your items that you store.

                                    This software can take advantage of the internet of things and become a part of the
                                    households’ devices and combine them into one. It can use smart watches that monitor
                                    health and smart alarm clock to monitor sleep schedules to provide the best possible
                                    food item suggestions to help boost our health. It will be able to use the
                                    environment for a better understanding and management of food items that is scanned.

                                    Shopping lists can be added into this software to ensure users never forget what
                                    they need at the supermarket, you are able to add items and can even directly be
                                    relocated to a Woolworths or a relevant store to order that food directly.

                                    If the software is integrated as a fridge software, it can link to a maps app and
                                    know when you are on the way home, so it will stop freezing certain foods or lets
                                    foods become warmer so when you arrive home, they will be ready to prepare.

                                    <h4>Example of the software</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    You open the software on your phone or a fridge or any other device, you scan the
                                    item: “cooked tomato pasta” the item will be added to the software and record the
                                    current date and time and adds the products expiration date, so we never stale or
                                    spoil the food added.
                                </div>

                                <div class="row border-bottom pb-5 mb-5"

                                    <h4>Software disadvantages/issues/restraints</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    UPC barcodes can be the same for the same brand shampoos. For example, heads and
                                    shoulders could have the same barcode for 2 of their shampoo brands. This is a issue
                                    when it comes to storing items in the fridge it may not recognize the item and will
                                    have trouble giving accurate results. This can be overcome with RFID tagging where
                                    RFID technology is able to give every product a unique identifier representing the
                                    product name and expiration date however, RDID tagging is most common in expensive
                                    clothing and higher value items as it costs about 10 cents a tag while UPC tags cost
                                    around 1 cent to implement, so generally food item manufacturers won’t opt out to
                                    RFID tagging.

                                    To make this software suitable technology is required. A suitable fast CPU with
                                    enough gigahertz to be fast enough. Enough RAM since this is a software developing
                                    project, we are going to need at least ATLEAST 16 gigabytes of RAM. Display is not a
                                    big problem as of developing this project. We would need an SSD for them fast data
                                    retrievals and quick boot ups to get to developing this project faster. GPUs aren’t
                                    of interest as well as we aren’t making application for graphical applications.

                                        This software will be very complex so coding languages such as HTML, JavaScript,
                                        CSS, Python etc. not knowing coding languages will make us struggle to even
                                        start on this project. It’s important to specialize in coding languages in order
                                        to add all the features of this software.

                                        Databases allow us to organize structure and information or in this case, food
                                        items and data on the items, we will need to know how to search for information
                                        to input these lines of information into a table format and organize into a
                                        secure database to use in our software.

                                        This is for storing information into a database while algorithms describe the
                                        process required to complete a task. We will need to know how to pick out data
                                        structures and algorithms to determine which combination can optimize the
                                        programs code.

                                        Every software in the world undergoes a testing process before a company
                                        releases it to users or consumers. Its just knowing how to test the software and
                                        using the correct digital tools to ensure that the software works and fulfills
                                        our design requirements.

                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Debugging is for our code part of the software. This is where we
                                        remove errors in our programs code and address them without problem-solving
                                        skills to determine where the error is occurring. Its important to know
                                        strategies for removing errors and develop an effective process to making sure
                                        the program works effectively.

                                        Operating system knowledge will help us understand how our software will run on
                                        different devices. It will help us conduct testing procedures and change lines
                                        of codes between them to fit the operating system.

                                        a software framework is a application that developers can use to create a
                                        program using information such as lines of codes that you already wrote before
                                        from other developers. Each operating system has a different framework. We will
                                        need to know different types of frameworks so that we have a wide variety of
                                        options to pick out from and develop our software in the best way possible.

                                    With the video games, the industry is large, it's probably the biggest in terms of
                                    revenue and actual profit. It's probably the biggest industry compared to, say, film
                                    and TV and music. Those industries combined still generates less money than video
                                    games. So, it's quite a large industry and it's obviously catering to a big

                                    looking for investment from our sense of like potentially entering partnerships

                                    There's a lot officer, discussions and negotiations, probably the hardest part of
                                    the job and some of it is also finding time to do other things only, not only
                                    focusing on work, but you also get wrapped up in it and you get into a trend like
                                    mindset of I'm going to do this over again and then it gets a bit extensive.

                                    The IT industry work that I do, I mean I couldn't really tell you because a lot of
                                    it is like kind of back-end stuff in that project. Video games like these, you know,
                                    it's all back end, technically it's ‘under the hood’. I'm not sure if I could share
                                    anything.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp; In that sense, I can probably give you files of data statistics and
                                    analysis we used in the project.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s 4000 different files and I don't know. I can't really give you the
                                    picture. I think I agree with that, but hopefully that helps you know, hopefully
                                    gives you an idea of this aspect because it is a big aspect of video game, so just
                                    don't have a Direct Line into it.

                                        Right now, Behavioral Analytics is a baseline requirement for advanced security
                                        in systems. It can use data and algorithms Aswell as machine learning to point
                                        out unusual behavior within applications or software which can help identify
                                        malicious behavior that are linked to certain types of attacks. Behavioral
                                        analytics can also help uncover root causes of attacks and provide insights on
                                        the attack.
                                    </p>

                                        Behavioral analytics can uncover malicious behavior by pointing out unusual
                                        timing of events and increased data movement for example.

                                        One of the biggest applications of behavioral analytics in security is detecting
                                        insider threats. This is where an employee of a company for example decides to
                                        go against his own company for personal reasons. Since an employee has access to
                                        personal company information no hacking is required. This is where behavioral
                                        analytics comes into play by detecting the employee's unusual behavior.

                                        The future of behavioral Analytics in cybersecurity is promising. Analytics will
                                        be able to fortify their defenses against cyber-attacks and will be able to
                                        respond and resolve issues faster and more efficiently. Behavioral analytics is
                                        rising in popularity due to data increasing every day. The more data being used
                                        the more security that can be provided through behavioral analytics as it can
                                        sift through all information and data given making it easier to point out
                                        unusual behavior. Behavioral analytics is not only used in security, but the
                                        future of behavioral analytics is also used in e commerce and finance. In the
                                        future, consumers won't even have to search for what they are looking for, it
                                        will be suggested to them through advertisements on television and websites and
                                        on their phones. People will be surrounded by their interests as their behavior
                                        online is all being monitored to give them what they are looking for. Behavioral
                                        analytics will help companies identify products that are most popular and help
                                        achieve success. AI technology contributes to behavioral analytics future as AI
                                        assistants and virtual assistants are becoming smarter and more advanced.
                                        behavioral analytics can make AI become more closer to humans than ever,

                                        either way. AI, machine learning, robots and robotic process which use
                                        behavioral analytics will make widespan redundancies in jobs or technologies
                                        making automation a common solution to business and people, but it will make the
                                        most out of data, AI and business advertising technologies. Analyzing and
                                        reporting people's behavior online and knowing their every move will make
                                        security almost impossible to break. Customer service, receptionists,
                                        proofreading work, manufacturing, retail services, physiatrists are all possible
                                        jobs that could be soon taken over with behavioral analytical technologies.

                                        This will also create jobs for IT specialists to modify or improve and even
                                        create even more efficient and powerful behavioral analytic techniques. People's
                                        shopping could be way quicker and will require less thought as what they are

                                        love the internet and devices and electronics and what it provides will be the
                                        most affected by this technology. Knowing people's behavior will potentially
                                        even stop major crime and predict future events, this could create an
                                        understanding of how certain processes or things are used and why such things
                                        happen. More analysis also leads to more insight for asking the right questions,
                                        behavioral analytics can lead scientists and people who are curious into the
                                        right direction. For example, in security we can use behavioral analytics to ask

                                        In my daily life, I will be suggested products every day that I won't even have
                                        to think about because my behavior online was matched with this product which I
                                        was initially interested in. Suspicious behavior that occurs on my devices or
                                        applications or accounts will be marked and will be notified to me instantly
                                        making my daily security exceptional and will leave me stress free. However
                                        personally, behavioral analytics makes me uncomfortable or gives me a feeling of
                                        no privacy. I feel like my life is monitored 24/7 and I cannot escape anything
                                        that I do online. My family members interests will be suggested on sites and
                                        YouTube for example the things they like will start to come up on suggestions
                                        and will make me more familiar with their hobbies which is a good thing. I can
                                        use behavioral analytics to my advantage to see what IT jobs are in demand and
                                        what employers are looking for in IT students to help me with my future. I could
                                        gain more broad knowledge on my interests and learn extensively about the things
                                        that interest me as more content and data is suggested to me. For example,
                                        through the amount of time I spend on certain websites. My life will become more
                                        simplified as AI assistants can help understand and memories what I look for
                                        everyday and the way I live my life. They could remind me to do certain things
                                        in the morning which I consecutively do everyday, they can guide me giving me
                                        directions to where im going in the car. Behavioral analytics in general will
                                        simplify not only Security but also business practices, IOT and life practices.

                                        Rasberry Pi is essentially a small sized computer that can be used just like a
                                        normal computer. Plugged in to a monitor with a mouse and keyboard, it is
                                        capable of playing High-definition video and can do pretty much everything a
                                        normal desk top can do.
                                    </p>

                                        It is very tiny, cheap and highly versatile computer that can fit into your
                                        pocket. There is a variety of uses for a rasberry pi which include using it for
                                        coding projects. You can use an entire operating systems with rasberry Pi such
                                        as Linux which is the main open source operating system for rasberry Pi. The
                                        main language for rasberry pie is Python. There are many different models of
                                        rasberry pi depending on the use that you have in mind for it. You can create a
                                        entire web server with PI and can stay on 24/7 without having to pay a massive
                                        electric bill, its also perfectly fast enough to handle loading up web pages and
                                        within local networks. The fact that the cheapest Raspberry Pi is around $4 USD
                                        and the most expensive version being $70 USD, (its about $60 AUD to 150 AUD
                                        now!), this is due to chip prices rising and the pandemic forced Raspberry pi to
                                        increase its prices. that alone shows its popularity and extraordinary features
                                        for its price. It is deemed the future of computing devices due to its ability
                                        to make use of IOT and being less expensive then most computing devices. The
                                        Rasberry Pi 4 allows you to play video games at 60 frames a second with inbuilt
                                        wifi and bluetooth to support wireless internet. Additionally the PI 4 gives you
                                        the capability to boot from a pen drive or USB attached drive, this will allow
                                        easing of remotely updating its systems and sharing system images between
                                        different machines which is an amazing feature considering its size its amazing.
                                        Raspberry Pi works best along side a desktop PC to enhance its functions such as
                                        online services, web browsing, office applications, and can act as extra memory
                                        even!

                                        impact on education and the world of computers. It has sold more than 40
                                        miillion units (cambridge uni) which have been used in numerous ways to benefit
                                        the world. Raspberry pi created a new class of computers, single board computers
                                        which make engineers, teachers, programmers and students lifes easier, cheaper
                                        and funner in every way possible. Raspberry Pi even has online resources where
                                        coding clubs, programmes and competitions have been provided to millions and
                                        millions of people from around the world providing excellent education and
                                        knowledge at a low cost.

                                        Since raspberry Pis are cheaper compared to other computers, this changes the
                                        way I shop for new computers. It makes me take into consideration the credit
                                        card sized computer that could do everything a normal laptop or pc can do for a
                                        fraction of a cost. Its logically the better choice to go with a raspberry pi
                                        unless im looking for something specific. My families and friends will also take
                                        into consideration of raspberry pi not just for personal use but to learn more
                                        about the world of computing, raspberry pi will also get them into programming
                                        and what it has to offer. This opens up educational opportunities and even
                                        possible future pathways that might change their mind on what they are doing
                                        right now. Whether its creating whole programming scripts or creating fun
                                        projects like a water dispenser or Bee/wasp counter, Raspberry Pi does not hold
                                        out on the fun it has, even building simple things. Perosnally iv gained
                                        interest into starting my own Raspberry Pi project where I use its touchscreen
                                        add on to create a small touch screen device which connects to my computer and
                                        displays statistics and information on my pc like temperature and ram usage.
                                        Ofcourse we can just use Raspberry Pi for fun but there's a whole world to
                                        explore with such a small device.

                                        Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software to
                                        predict outcomes without being programmed or told to do so. Its based on
                                        algorithms and uses historical data to predict all its outputs. Machine learning
                                        provides with

                                        All these beneifts help businesses and or scientists to predict outcomes easily.
                                        For example, a business that sells a new product can predict its sell rate by
                                        accessing human purchase data to see what products are most bought and it will
                                        do its magic to figure out a algorithm to show how successful this new product
                                        may be. Many leading companies of today use machine learning such as Facebook,
                                        google and uber. Machine learning helps with decision making within applications

                                                Supervised machine learning consists of learning a function based on a
                                                input and out put of labeled data. For example, giving 3 apples and 2
                                                bananas to a model that is using unsupervised machine learning will
                                                predict that it's an apple and banana while a supervised machine model
                                                will show exactly 3 apples and 2 bananas. Basically its developing
                                                predictive models based on both inputs and outputs of data.

                                        Speech recognition is one of many machines learning technologies which is a
                                        computer speech recognition or speech to text technology which allows users to
                                        use a microphone to speak and allows the computer to process the human speech
                                        into a written format. An example of this technology is Siri on apple iPhone.

                                        Computer vision is my favorite and most interesting technology in my opinion
                                        that uses machine learning. This AI technology enables computers and systems to
                                        derive meaningful information from digital images and any other online visual
                                        inputs. Based on the data it pulls from those visual representations it can take
                                        action. Image recognition, photo tagging, radiology imaging in healthcare and
                                        self-driving cars are all part of machine learning computer vision technology.

                                        There are many more technologies to list that use machine learning. Thanks to
                                        the enormous amount of data technology has created today, machine learning is
                                        getting more advanced every single day and in the next 10 years or so all those
                                        technologies listed above will be completely unrecognizable and unbelievable.
                                        quantum computing has also made machine learning possible as it enables faster
                                        data processing which boosts machine learning capabilities. Googles quantum
                                        computer in 2019 completed a task in 200 seconds which would havce taken the

                                        Healthcare is using a lot of machine learning for faster paitent diagnois, it
                                        can also preditct health problems based on age status, genetic history etc, and
                                        can prevent illnesses from occurring. The most commonly used in the healthcare
                                        industry today is accurately scanning and detecting tumors in radiology scans
                                        detecting cancer using machine learning.

                                        These autonomous vehicles rely on sensors, complex algorithms, machine learning
                                        systems and powerful processors to execute code and software. Their radar
                                        sensors can pick up surroundings and create and maintain a map of nearby
                                        vehicles and the environment. They could even pick up and understand stop signs,
                                        pedestrians using some light detections and ranging. Sensors bounce pulses of
                                        light off the cars surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges and
                                        identify road markings.

                                        Advanced driver assistance technology right now is able to prevent crashes and
                                        lane departure prevention as well as blind spot detection and rear crash
                                        prevention systems. These technologies make our lives easier and our driving
                                        better and more comfortable. These technologies were then followed up by many
                                        car brands such as Mercedes which took autonomous vehicles even further when
                                        they introduced drive pilot which allows the driver to hand over direct control
                                        of steering, speed and even supervising overall operation of the car. Tesla is
                                        the biggest integrator of autonomous vehicles. They have a auto lane changer,
                                        autopilot navigation, auto park, summoning the vehicle from a parking spot or

                                        errors so imagine of millions of these autonomous cars are on the road at the
                                        same time, there will be no need for traffic lights. For instance, rear ending a
                                        vehicle since you weren't paying attention cannot be caused by an autonomous
                                        car. Autonomous vehicles are safer in preventing types of accidents that have to
                                        do with human error.

                                        Who will need 8 airbags and a heavy chunk of metal to protect them when
                                        accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot when your car can come pick you
                                        up from work later? Who needs to book a flight when you can leave whenever you
                                        like sleeping half of the time and arrive at your destination swiftly.

                                        Taxi and limousine industries will substantially be impacted or could even
                                        potentially create new ones to be used with autonomous vehicles.

                                        Autonomous vehicles in the future will be more reliable and safer than being
                                        driven by a human due to all the advances in technology. Generally autonomous
                                        vehicles will rely on camera technology especially since new cameras recently
                                        are able to generate 3d measurements at long range and since future platforms
                                        will be strongly driven by both safety and cost considerations.

                                        Autnomous vehicles will also make jobs such as truck drivers redundant, now me
                                        personally I love to hear this news because I do not like truck drivers however
                                        since this self driving tech is so widespread and is in mass development
                                        transporting goods in trucks will be automated in the future. This means that
                                        suppliers may invest in automated transportation rather then paying employees to
                                        deliver their goods. Not only that but at the same time;

                                        Howevrer there are some cons and risks too such as cyber attacks. Imagine
                                        getting your supply track hacked and being driven the opposite direction then
                                        losing track of its location. Extensive software maintance and upgrades will
                                        also include high cost of integration and use which will take lots of business
                                        time aswell but in the long run the future is very promising and is looking to
                                        make many of our lives easier in a way.

                                        Not just me, everyone in my life and around me will be dramatically impacted by
                                        this technology in the future. Growing up as a teenager I needed to get my
                                        license and Ps to drive around in my car acting cool, with autonomous vehicles
                                        there will be no need for a license as the car itself tests to see if you are
                                        able to drive it or not. Parents won't have to pick me up from my soccer games
                                        as I can just tap my phone and the car will come by and pick me up on time.
                                        Going to school in the morning couldn’t be easier, getting dropped off on time
                                        by car. Travelling around the country in general will be much easier and more
                                        comfortable. transport business won't need licensed drivers as they begin to
                                        order autonomous vehicles which drive themselves through applications getting
                                        called by users transporting them to their location and staying on standby till
                                        it is called to a nearby location again. We would be relying on our vehicles
                                        heavily and most people around the world would be finding it easier autonomously
                                        getting driven to their destination. Everyone would be entrusting software to
                                        deliver them from point A to point B.
